Create a csharp project that illustrates how a time sensitve password hack could be used to gain unauthorized access to a system. 
The project should include code that demonstrates the vulnerability, as well as comments explaining how the hack works and how to mitigate such vulnerabilities in real-world applications.
For example a password check that returns a different time for each character matched can be exploited using a timing attack.
