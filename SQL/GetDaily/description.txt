In a financial app, I want to create a graph showing the total model holdings over time for a specific model.
However, a query must be run daily to get today's model values.

create the sql queries where: 
on server "money":
The database has the following tables:
A model table that references a model group. columns: modelid, modelgroupid.
A model group table. columns: modelgroupid, portfolioid, portfolioweight. There may be multiple portfolios in a model, with weights adding up to 1.
A portfolio table: columns: portfolioid, instrumentid.

In another server "ios" the portfiolios and instruments are defined:
portfolio: columns: portfolioid, instrumentid
instrument: instrumentid, instrumentvalue, date
