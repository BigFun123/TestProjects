in BloomFilter/Strategy2
1. Create a mssql table with 3 columns: id, name (VARCHAR(6$)), bloom (BIGINT UNSIGNED). 
2. Create a SQL demo of a fast lookup by using  "bloom" column: When a row is added or modified, a simple bitflipping algorithm will flip the bits of the bloom column according to the string content of the name column.
3. Write another sql file to search the table, performing bitwise operators on the bloom column to quickly search.
4. Write a testing query to test performance between regular select operation vs searching by the bloom column
